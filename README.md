# WP Starter
The files included are a starting point for your next WordPress site.

## Core Functionality
Contains all of your WordPress site's core functionality so that it is **theme independent**.

A good rule-of-thumb is that anything a user would expect to keep after changing themes belongs here. This includes custom post types, taxonomies, custom metaboxes, shortcodes, and customizations to other plugins.

For specific functionality that’s reusable and/or the client might want to selectively disable, it’s best to build as its own plugin.

`core-functionality.php`

## Theme Functionality
That which relates to the look and feel of the site - contains several commonly used functions to use as a reference for building your theme's functions.php file.

`theme-functionality.php`
