# WP Starter Kit
A starter theme to eliminate the most redundant tasks and jumpstart building WordPress sites.
Tested with WordPress 5.6.

## Core Functionality Plugin
Contains all of your WordPress site's core functionality so that it is **theme independent**.

A good rule-of-thumb is that anything a user would expect to keep after changing themes belongs here. This includes custom post types, taxonomies, custom metaboxes, shortcodes, and customizations to other plugins.

For specific functionality that’s reusable and/or the client might want to selectively disable, it’s best to build as its own plugin.

## Notes
- /core-functionality/ goes into the plugins folder.
- /ivy-starter-theme/ goes into the themes folder.
- [View the theme in action and read the developer's guide](http://ivystarter.wpengine.com/).
